The participants need to bring only Rs.300 each for the Hike, which will be used for food only,and extra expenses should be bared by the hikers themselves . Please gear up for the hike DeerHikers.

"Hello All,    On the behalf of IT Club, I would like to duly inform everyone that some serious issues have been encountered in the lab.     USB and LAN cables left open : This issue has been taken seriously from now on. Every time we, the club members visit to inspect the lab, we encounter open cables here and there. Such an inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated now. I on the behalf of the entire IT club, would like to sincerely request everyone to place the LAN cables and USB cables inside the respective computer after being used. It makes the LAB environment look messy as well as can cause damage to hardware parts if some unintended accidents may take place. Whatever it may be, it can cause a great deal to the college itself and the members of IT club will be responsible for it. We are not school children, are we? From now on, we will be assuming that none of us will create such problems in upcoming future. Everyone has been complaining about the Wi-Fi connection problem. If we start becoming engaged in maintaining unnecessary mess, how can we concentrate on resolving other important matters? We hope that everyone will co-operate with us from now on. It\'s our college; let\'s make it the best.   "" Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we\'ve been waiting for.

"'Hello All,  Effective immediately, we have changed the configuration of DWIT hotspot, i.e. one student can use hotspot only in one device (previously 2 devices were allowed). This is only a test to check whether it will solve the problem of bandwidth.  Similarly, the timeout for the hotspot login has been increased. i.e you must Logout every time once you Login into the hotspot (you won\'t be automatically logged out like before). If you do not log out, your session will not expire and you won\'t be able to login next time. The browser will show an error which may read "" no more session allowed... "". Bottomline is you must Logout from any device once logged in.   About WI-Fi connection problem : Members of IT Club along with Niraj Shakya dai from IT Department, DWS sat together this Saturday and checked the whole DWIT network from  VIANET  link to every switch and ports in DWIT. We found no errors in the LAN ports, while investigating we concluded there may be some problems in switches used in DWIT floor 2 (in Lab) and error in subnet masking in DWIT floor 1. We also replaced the Access Point (AP) of DWIT floor 2 since there was performance issue in previous AP.  There\'s still an issue, but we are trying our best to solve the problem. Everyone please cooperate with us.  Regards, Sagar Giri (The IT Club - DWIT) '",1
"""Hello Guys,  I am kind of pissed of because of the mismanagement that is going on in the club. When you are assigned any topic during the meeting, it becomes your responsibility to submit the articles on time. You cannot fool around saying that you did not have time or you had nothing in mind or whatever it is. You must submit your articles on time. If there is any serious problem, you need to inform me on time so that I can arrange for some backup plan. I am certainly always smiling and friendly and all that, but when it comes to work I am serious. And, I expect the same from everyone.  Further, being editors and co-editor-in-chiefs, we need to ask our reporters/editors about their work status and push them towards their work to get things done on time. If we show negligence on this matter, we cannot expect others to be responsible.  See, I know I sound rude now, but it has been almost a couple of weeks that I have been working in haste, waking up till 1 to 2 at night. If you all send the articles on time, this will certainly not happen.  Also, in the meeting, everyone should have some prior idea for the topics for the site.

"""Dear members,  I need to address a few things about the News Club's activities and our weekly publishing.  The group has not been pulling its weight in the past few weeks. Articles are not submitted on time, editors are late and more so than before, I don't even get to see the articles before they are published.  This is unacceptable and it is going to change. You are going to take responsibility for what is assigned to you and do it on a timely manner. We are capable of doing this, and I trust that you will consider these pointers seriously.  1) The deadline for reporters is Saturday  5 PM. Any later than Saturday, your articles will not be accepted for that week.  2) The deadline for editors is Sunday 5 PM.. If I don't read your edited articles by Sunday, they will not be published. Period.  3) If I have not read and edited an article, it will not be published. That means NO last minute submissions.  4) Pick your topics ahead of time. If you are unsure, ask but not the night before the deadline.  5) If you have been inactive for more than two weeks, meaning  you have not contributed any work, I need to speak to you and we should reconsider whether you want to continue as a member of the club.  Drop me a line if you have questions or concerns. I think we have done great work in the past and are fully able to produce much better work in future.  Sincerely, Menosh """,1

"""Hi All,  Please adhere to following proposal specially when writing 'news' in your site.  1. Try establish the linkages -  Let's say you are writing on Magh 8 and constitution. You can easily relate that with how it has affected students of DWIT. There should be a DWIT connection, if its not so explicit. In case of Constitution, you could have said how it affected students because of bandh and how some students had walk to exam centers for board exams. If there is no linkage its implied that we are not concerned about it.  So no linkages - no news.  2. Quotes -  I am not sure how many of you have been following my suggestion of referring to a news of any news site of same repute. If you are reporting on an issue there should be minimum of three quotes so that the reader is forced to believe that this student actually went on to create a news. So, no quotations - no news.  3. News Headlines  Off late there has been comments regarding the topic of some of the news post. Example ' Mentoring Program for Freshmen <http://dwitnews.com/mentoring-program-freshmen/>' - someone commented to me that its not an ideal way. I do not know much about how it should be but what I have been told is there should be a 'verb' in the Headline and I tend to agree with it. So it was suggested that 'Mentoring Program for Freshmen Started', things would have been much more clear.   Please do not publish any news unless and until these three guidelines are adhered to.

We would now like to talk to you guys, and show you what we have been able to make. You could let us know any feature you'd like for us to include and we will try our best to get it done.

Every year, roughly 10,000+ students from out of the valley come to Kathmandu to pursue their higher studies. Most of them do not have a place to live in so they reside in hostels. Searching hostels in preferred choice can grow as intense as walking along the streets and visiting hostels door-to-door. So, acknowledging that problem, we have provided an easy-to-search solution to all the students. With the help of this website, searching can be really easy and comfortable for the students.   OUR MISSION   To provide online information and services to the students who are in search of hostels to live in.  Our Team: http://merohostel.com/aboutUs  Do visit the website, like our page on Facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/merohostel) and send your words to us.  Sincerely, Bidish Acharya (on behalf of merohostel.com team) '",2

The point I am trying to make is simple. Irrespective of whether you are on leave to prepare for exams or even busy in the midst of exams, as long as exam time and activity time do not coincide, all events will have to go on as usual. Coming to college to participate in a Deertalk program if you are a selected as a participant, for example, and go home after the event is over is perfectly okay.  We have talked to all of the club leaderships and made it absolutely clear to them that they have every right to call you for meetings even if you are on leave!  From next Monday onward, we have made it clear that all Class Representatives must be present in CR Meeting with management scheduled for every Monday, 4:50 PM.  This is just an example.   Please get this straight from here on. Coming to college for 45 minutes or two hours meeting is perfectly fine even if classes are off for you.Unless its a vacation declared in college calendar, your presence at college can be solicited anytime and you are expected to be here. No excuses!  Finally, do not expect us to conduct activities as per your convenience. This will NOT happen. We will conduct events in a manner we deem best fit for a best educational institute.

"""Hello All, Considering the request of many students we had given all of you a chance to return your overdue books without paying fines. Many of you had even returned the books, but there are still many books which have not been returned. The attachment below provides the list of students who have not still returned their books with the fines they will have to pay if they returned the books by tomorrow. Please remember that the more days you will wait the fines will increase. Thus, return your books as soon as possible. If there is any confusion regarding the list talk to us in the library.  P.S: I have heard many of you saying you had returned the books to Narayan dai or someone else and the books are missing from the library itself. So, from next time when you return a book make sure that it is recorded and you returned it to me or Mohan. Just don't leave it there and escape away, because it is only going to harm you. We are not responsible for your carelessness.  Regards, Prabina Neupane """,3

"'Dear Students,  DWIT is about to launch the Harvard CS50 course (https://cs50.harvard.edu) starting from Sunday at 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.  Everyone is invited and I look forward to meet you all during that session.  I would like to mention a few thing about this course:  0. The objective of the course is to teach you how to learn different programming languages. The objective is not to make you experts but to make you knowledgeable and confident enough to learn on your own.  1. While we cannot do everything according the Harvard standard, we will try to accommodate the course as per our Nepali context and resources.  2. It will be held every weekend on Saturday afternoons from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. (except this weekend)  3. First and Second sessions are compulsory and rest of sessions are optional. But you have to maintain certain degree of class participation and presence to claim that they have successfully completed the course.  4. The actual course in the Harvard website is 12 weeks long, with two 1 hour lectures every week, and it introduces many different ideas and concepts. However, we are attempting to cover it in 7 weeks. I hope to cover most of the stuff in the course, but it might not be possible that I will be able to go through all of them. Therefore, you should expect that I will assign some of the material for self study.  5. Engineering is not a spectator sport. While there will not be any quizzes or exams, assignments will be given. Students attending the class will be expected to complete a problem set given in https://cs50.harvard.edu/psets  6. At the end of the session, students will be asked to do a group project. The projects will be accessed by other faculty members and the best project will be given an award.   Best Regards, Sudarshan Guruacharya '",3

"'Dear Students,  It was unfortunate that we could not hold the Harvard CS50 class on Saturday as planned. As such I am giving you this assignment via email.  You are required to do the first problem set in the Harvard CS50 course which can be found in http://cdn.cs50.net/2014/fall/psets/0/pset0/pset0.html  The problem set asks you to have fun with Scratch and implement a project of your choice (be it an animation, a game, interactive art, or anything else), subject only to the following requirements.     -     Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must    resemble something other than a cat.    -     Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not    necessarily three per sprite).    -     Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.    -     Your project must use at least one sound.    -     Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in    lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be    less complex than, say,  Pikachu\xe2\x80\x99s Pastry Catch  and  Ivy\xe2\x80\x99s Hardest Game .    As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.  You can refresh your memory by reviewing similar kinds of  examples that we went through in the class in the Youtube videos embedded in the problem set webpage.  To complete the problem you need to download the Scratch program in your computer which is about 35 MB. (Goto http://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/) While not necessary, it is recommended that you join the scratch community for ideas and support during the building of your project.  Once you have done your project, go to Google Drive and upload the source code in the CS50 -> Problem Set 1 folder that I have shared with all the students. In case you did not get the invitation, then please promptly contact me. Put all your code in a subfolder with your name as roll number as the subfolder name. Since there is no grades or assessments for this course, I will be adopting a peer review scheme to check the assignments. I will be assigning each submission to be peer reviewed by 5 other students. The reviewers will need to give feedback to the author of the code, and describe his/her strong and weak points. You will find the list of reviewers assigned to each student and what you are supposed to put in your review in the CS50 folder.  Happy Coding!!  Sudarshan Guruacharya '",3

"'Hello All,  This is to notify you that this email address is going to be the official email address to contact with the librarians. From now on there will be four people working in the library; 3 assistant librarians (from students) and 1 full time librarian.    The names and shifts of all librarians for weekdays are as follows:  Mohan Singh Bomrel- 7: 00 am - 8:00 am  Asha Poudel- 8:00 am - 9:00 am  Shivangi Sharma-  9:00 am - 6:00 pm  Prabina Neupane- 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm    Students can issue/ return/ renew books anytime between this time period.    The library will be open on Sundays from 9:00 am - 1:00 pm.    The rules that each student need to follow while using the library were discussed in the All Hands Meeting, but since many of you seem to be confused with the rules we would like to revise the rules for you once again.    1. One student can issue only 3 books at a time, except for Batch 2015.    2. The student can issue a course book for 7 business days and fictions for 14 business days.    3. A book can be continuously re-issued for maximum 2 times by a student if the book is not on demand.    4. Students are only supposed to return books to library staffs. The library management will not be responsible for loss of books in other condition.    5. After the deadline is over, students will have to pay a fine of Rs 5 per business days. This includes your exams too.    6. The student will have to be preset themselves while issuing/ renewing or returning books.    7. In case of loss of any books, please notify to library management as soon as possible.    8. Students will not be allowed to issue reference books and magazines.     Happy Reading!! :) '",3
"""Hi All,  As you all are aware by now, we've been looking for various 'interesting' courses and gradually dishing them out to you. I am sure you must have noticed that,as far as practicable, we are seeking the courses that are run in the best institutions of the world.   Harvard CS50 is one such course .  We really did not feel like imposing it on you and decided to make it optional from 3rd session on. I don't think I would be wrong if I were to say that even after attending first two mandatory sessions, there must be some of you who have no clue as to what was done in those sessions. Perhaps the only paradox here is that the best are getting even better by attending such sessions whereas someone who really needs to practice coding are losing a lot! Is that fair? Perhaps, NOT.  As students, I can understand your tendency to not to do things unless and until its mandatory or something you really really like. So no complaints! However, I am sure you must also have seen the amount of effort that has gone to run this course - right from selecting the course to finding the most suitable person to teach the course.  Hence, I have decided to do the following.  1. For those who have attended the third session of this season's CS50, you are expected ( MUST ) to complete the course. College will provide you with course completion certificate after fulfilling the necessary requirements as mandated by the course.  2. For rest, I am working out on running this course once every year, at least. Hence, if you have missed out this time, no worries, you will get a second chance or may be a third as well depending on which year you are in. The only condition I have decided to attach is that ' Each student must have completed this course during his/her four year of stay at DWIT '. If one fails to do so, college will not recognize you as a 'rightful' graduate of DWIT. We will say you failed to complete your graduation from  DWIT  certain course, may be in footnote somehwere!  Hence I request you all to be mindful to figure out which category the course falls in every time a new course gets announced. It need not always be H-CS50.   1. MUST ATTEND ONE SESSION COURSE [NO CHOICE BUT ATTEND W/O THINKING MUCH]  or   2. MUST ATTEND DURING FOUR YEARS OF YOUR STAY AT DWIT[ ATTEND DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU THINK IS THE RIGHT TIME]  or   3. COMPLETELY OPTIONAL [NO BINDINGS].    Thanks. Chief Academic Officer, DWIT.  PS: I am sure you all take this positively. There will be many more such courses in future. """,3

At the same time, we are left with no choice but lose someone dear, someone close, someone without whom life's unimaginable, at some point in Nepal. That's the brutal reality of life.

When we lose someone as close, the onus lies on us to ensure that we keep the memories alive by cherishing all the good times we had in times of togetherness.

"""Hi All,  This practice was well in place when got started. Everyone had the cards nicely 'hung'! And, for some reason, people slowly decided that it's really not important to carry the card or even if I have to carry why 'wear' it, I can safely tuck inside my purse or wallet!  Since we did not emphasize much, I share the blame for not having the system implemented in the manner envisaged. On certain occasions, its not just you but I have seen my own colleagues and members of Administration Team not adhering to this one simple rule. Lets not dig much into it.  Please remember that it's mandatory that each and every person associated with DWIT  MUST  be wearing the  ID card  at all times while inside the campus. There are now around 550 plus people plus workers, plus people coming for training inside this premise at any given point in time.

"'Dear Students,  I would like to congratulate a total of 35 students who submitted the Scratch program assignment for the effort and diligence. I have given short reviews for your programs, which you can find in the shared folder of Google Drive.  Technical advise to those who attempted:  - When using multiple copies of same sprite, many students copy-pasted the code to different sprite. This is quite an inefficient coding style. A better method is to use the ""clone"" puzzle piece that can be found in the ""Control"" block. This allows you to create multiple copies of a single sprite during run-time, thus keeping the code more compact. A short readable example is given in my ""snowfall"" example. You can read more about it in http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Cloning  - Students who created racing games may want to explore how to create scrolling backgrounds, so that your game does not terminate once the car (or whatever sprite you may be using) reaches the edge of the stage. You can read more about it here: http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scrolling_(sprites) and an example project is here http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10160196  Best Wishes, Sudarshan Guruacharya '",3

"""When was the last time you ended up sleeping without realizing where you are? The logical explanations would be the time when you drank your heart out ( lungs out, stomach out?), or perhaps fainted?  We had someone who fell asleep while trying to build something only to be woken up by cleaner didis in the morning. The other two days, or rather nights, he went home  ONLY  to sleep. Yes, you are right that it is against the rule to stay in school over night but college too cannot take any action for doing something in the past and that too for something which college was totally unaware of.  Hearing him share lot of things was mesmerizing. When you are in 2nd year and you have devoted days and hours trying to put things in a place so that things will work as desired, the pain of losing the entire folder suddenly seems too overwhelming. By his own admission, he ran from pillar to post to see if he can recover the lost folder and when all the effort went in vain, he simply felt like breaking his own machine into pieces.  So much for melodrama.  The product got finally built after sheer perseverance and hard work. It took a while for him to decide whether to go for IntelliJ or Groovy! Then there were design issues. He could visualize the product but could not put it in design. Yes, there were times when he had to resort to various stackoverflow(s) to seek references. And he read loads of pdf files on programming! And then there was his senior who was able to explain clearly as to how a function works for the first time ever! The inference we drew was that he might have learnt about how a function works from various teachers but at the end of the day, his so called 'moment-of-enlightenment' came from none other than his friend.  The next question is why was he so much under duress? Was that an assignment or a project that he had to submit within that period? Was he competing (in a competition)? The answer is NO. All he had to do is make a point to no one but himself! Throw something at him and he can shape it into a product, that's his confidence that he shared.  The person who made a point to himself was  Suman Thapa, Class of 2016 , and ended up building a product called project tracker that would help keep track of which stage a project has reached!  All of this is something 8-9 of us got to know in DeerChautari Session held on 12/2/2014.  Next week, we will get to see a new product and/or hear from someone new about something s/he has done.  There is no bigger sense of happiness than to see someone candidly share his experience and share a piece of software he has built.    DeerChautari is all about getting to know from each other and share the products you have built in a chautari like setting where no discussion is formal. And, lastly be it an idea or a product, if you do not share its obvious that it does not exist. Come learn and share from each other.   On behalf of DeerChautari Club. """,4

"""Dear All Theatre Lovers: One World Theatre is showing the Nepal Premiere of Yerma (1934), the classic folk tragedy by the great Spanish poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, directed and designed by the brilliant Bimal Subedi, and translated into Nepali by the scholar/poet Sristi Bhattarai [One of our English Faculty]. DWIT family is visiting to watch the performance of Yerma on 14th of December, 2014, Sunday at 5 pm sharp at Theatre Village, Lazimpat. The outstanding cast features film and stage actors Namrataa Shrestha, Rajkumar Pudasaini, Kamal Mani Nepal, and Srijana Adhikari. Striking set design, a chorus of village women, masks by Sajan Thapa Magar (mask maker for The Jumping Frog), Flamenco dance by Sumnima Sampang, and composed music by Jason Kunwar has made the play enjoyable. The play shares the theme of a woman yearning for a child and searching for a self-identity. The play has tremendous resonance in Nepal where a woman is often defined by her role as a wife and mother, and a childless woman can be devalued and replaced by a second wife. We are planning to make the reservations at Theatre Village on the mentioned date. The box office offers ticket at Rs 200 for adults, Rs 100 for students with ID Reservations. If you are interested to go for watching the play, Please fill the shared form by Thursday eob. Thanks, Bijaya.   I've invited you to fill out the form The Play.
