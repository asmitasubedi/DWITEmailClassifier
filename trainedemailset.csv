Despite that, we can utilize  that small gap of time before sleeping for reading books.  Yes, reading books. It is really wonderful to read and discuss accordingly at times at various scenarios.

Your way of thinking changes, meaning you build analyzing capability. Ultimately, you can improve a lot in your writing.  So far, we have read:  1) Freakonomics  by Steven D.

" Hello All,      The IT Club has performed various numbers of testing and observations for finding the cause of internet issue inside college. We are able to inspect the issue with the LAN and it is already solved. And we are currently working on improving wireless networks, the inspection of issue in wireless network is almost done, the issue is found to be the limitations in the capacity of APs to handle more number of clients. So we performed testing by allocating separate APs for different batches of the college. From the survey and monitoring we performed, we found that there is improvement in the connections. And the connections are better than before.  We are still extending the duration of observations. If your device has any problem in connecting with the APs, Please report it immediately to our members Suryaraj or Sagar. If you wont find them, then inform the issue immediately to the college admin.       Instructions for connecting devices with the APs   1.  Separate APs are allocated for each section. So confirm the APs allocated for you.  2.  SSID and respective passwords were sent to members of The IT Club from your section, hence get it from them.  3.  If you think, you have already set the passwords for the same APs, please reset the password and enter the new password.  4.  Try for connection.    If the connection issue exists, then report it to the Club members as mentioned above.    Note: Please do not share the password to other sections and batches, it will surely trouble.    We would like to apologize for the inconvenience cause.    Thanks,  The IT Club. '",1

"Thank you all for attending my all hands meeting earlier this week. Things you all need to pay attention to are very basic and obvious. You will therefore forget and ignore them if we do not reemphasize on a regular basis. Please note below as a summary of my all hands meeting:  1. Respect to faculty will not be compromised at DWIT. We will not tolerate if a student is found to disrespect faculty inside and/or outside the classroom.  2. Entrepreneurship is the foundation of DWIT. We want all of our students grow as job creators,  not job seekers.  As I mentioned, computer science is a medium which can be used to solve real world problems. If you do not know what real world issues are, study of computer science can\'t be useful and does not serve the purpose of spending four years at DWIT. That\'s why we encourage you all to observe all social and economical issues people in your neighborhood and cities and villages have been facing. Think how you can use your computer science education to solve socio-economic issues. If you do not stop thinking, you will get there. Opportunities are tremendous. To allow you all to understand businesses which are servicing  communities in various ways, we will be sending you to intern with our corporate partners. Once you understand their businesses, you will appreciate the work entrepreneurs (no mater how small they are) do create jobs and to serve communities. As a computer scientist, you need to question yourself ""how can I make ""A"" business run more efficiently?""  3. A graduate of computer science can pursue career in three different areas if I may stratify the opportunities -- technical, semi-technical and purely business.  That is the reason we expose you to 100+ different required and elective courses. We want you to be ready to choose future career path based on your interest and dream. We do not ask you to engage in so many different clubs and extra-cuuricular activities not just because we want to look cool. DWIT is the place where you should be able to   find who you are what you are good at. So try as many things as you can till you find sth you love to do. College life should be fun guided by principle of respect, freedom and hard work.   That is all till next time. Thank you all and get back yo work now.  best  rudra   --    ___________________________________    Rudra Pandey, PhD, Executive Chairman \xe2\x94\x82Deerwalk Inc.\xe2\x94\x82430 Bedford Street, Lexington MA 02420   \xe2\x94\x82  rpandey@deerwalk.com <rpandey@deerwalk.com>\xe2\x94\x82781 325 2291 | 977-98010-91446 (Nep) | http://www.deerwalk.com <http://www.deerwalk.com>   --    DISCLAIMER: This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

The story is:-  After he received the fund, both of us were working together and he had shared what he had really wanted to say in the program. In his own words, "" student harule bench ma chewing gum  tansdincha, ani bencha bokda mero lugama tansera luga bigrincha.

This is not mandatory but 8 minutes of your time may help us understand lemons better! This is not mandatory. Thanks.       Dear Respondent, We are bunch of researchers, (students of M. Phil. Program at Kathmandu University School of Management (KUSOM) trying to investigate a certain phenomenon, The Lemons Market. ""The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism"" is a 1970 paper by the economist George Akerlof. It discusses information asymmetry, which occurs when the seller knows more about a product than the buyer. A lemon is an American slang term for a car that is found to be defective only after it has been bought. Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz jointly received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001 for their research related to asymmetric information. Akerlof\'s paper uses the market for used cars as an example of the problem of quality uncertainty. It concludes that owners of good cars will not place their cars on the used car market. This is sometimes summarized as ""the bad driving out the good"" in the market. Therefore; we have selected our research topics as STUDY OF LEMONS MARKET IN NEPAL but with special focus on Motorbike instead of Motorcars inside the Kathmandu Valley. The main purpose of this study is to know how the Lemons market is functioning in Nepal.  Below you will find a questionnaire, we will be obliged if you please kindly contribute some of your valuable time to complete this questionnaire. We would like to assure you that the information provided by you through the questionnaire will be kept confidential maintaining the secrecy and privacy. The information provided by you will not be used elsewhere, except in our research project.      I\'ve invited you to fill out the form Understanding ""The Lemons Market"".

Yes I mentioned to all that head can be move from left to right or right to left for C-Look, Scan and C-Scan however we need to check the question properly if the movement of head has already mentioned on the given question paper like ""The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder 43, and previous request was at cylinder 25"" so from this question we can see that head is moving from left to right bcoz previously it was request at Cylinder 25 then currently at 43 which means head definitely move from left to right. so once we have move head from left to right then we shd follow left to right afterward right to left. if that kinda tricky question will not mention then we will follow right to left ok.  if you have any question feel free to ask me la.

Its home screen displays six options that includes Edit, Collage, Filter Camera, Material, More Beautiful, and Emotion Lab. You can do all the basic adjustments. You can crop, rotate, and adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast using the Editing tool. You can apply filters like soft light, blue tone, and autumn effect on the camera using Filter Camera option. Not only that, clicking a photo using the Filter Camera takes you to the editing tool automatically.   This has got option \xe2\x80\x98Effects And Enhancements where effects can be added just like filters even after the photos are taken. The effects that are available here are divided into four categories, namely Portrait, Classic, Scene, and Art. This app has also got beautify option, where you can beautify any portraits by whitening, removing blemishes, and enlarging eyes. Here are slimming features by use of which we can look slim. You can add eyeliners and blushers in your face by the use of beatify option.    Why is it my favorite  -  Who wouldnt want to look beautiful all the time? I love clicking photos all the time and even look more beautiful in my photos. Whatever is my mood, I need selfie for refreshment. Though I am feeling low, I can smile at the camera and my smiling face always makes me happy. This app has got many features. There is not a single feature I get bored with. Sometime I dont feel like putting on lip gloss or eye linear, but still I want to look beautiful. By use of beatify option, I can add eye liner and gloss. This is an amazing feature. It has been a friend of mine who even makes laugh sometimes. I can add hat or other accessories in the photo and get entertainment. Every feature and every options take me to the new entertaining world and playing with photos is something I love doing. This app is an actual wonder.    Where did I find it  -  Once I was using my friends mobile and knew about the features of photo wonder and I searched it in my mobile. I found it in Appstore and downloaded it.     Developers  -  The app is developed by the Beijing Baidu Netcom Science & Technology Co., Ltd.    How to download -   This app is available for different platforms like Android and ios.

"Hi All,  It\'s good to see everyone practicing their performances on the balcony, inside classrooms and at times even in the cramped space where the sofas are placed. It\'s equally pleasing to see place buzzing with flurry of activities long after classes are over.  The reason for this email, however, is slightly on a different note.  Apparently, it looks like I spoke bit too soon. The reason I say so is when some of you came asking whether one can perform on Hindi songs and dances, I said \'Yes\'. Perhaps I got carried away by your enthusiasm!  We really want to promote our culture and heritage. I have long been associated with management team of both college and company and I can tell you for sure that on every such occasion dating back to 2008 when we had our first company fest, we have always said \'\'No"" to hindi items. Is it a cultural bias? No. Its just we want to promote our own culture in whatever way we can. It\'s worth reminding you all that the reason we said ""No"" to hindi items during our DEERFEST was in keeping up with that trend. I now realize that I did not do my job well. I should have tabled this in one of our weekly management meetings and not raise it in a meeting one week before the event. I keep on asking you to notify well ahead of time. Ironically I ended up doing the exact opposite.  The core organizing team met today for DEERUTSAV.   Here\'s what has been decided:  - We will try divide the program into two portions.  - The first part will of \'formal\' in nature. We will have distribution of prizes along with one or two Hindi performances plus nepali / english performances.   - We will break for early dinner. We will resume performances right after dinner. You all are one big bundle of energy and hence I don\'t think \'filled\' stomach will not make any difference. - In second part, i.e. post dinner, we will try fit in all the Hindi performances ( those that get thru the auditions ). Now, this perhaps is the exact reason I am writing this email.  Should I not manage to get an approval from management in next meeting to accommodate Hindi performances, we all have no choice but stop. Period. We will have to do away with some of the hindi performances even if they have been selected by Menosh during auditions on Sunday.  And should such be the case, my sincere apologies ( in advance ) to those who have spend considerable amount of time practicing   their performances. I even do not know how should I express how bad I feel in a manner that you can relate to how bad exactly I am feeling.  I know this will take many of you by surprise, unfortunately in an unpleasant manner. You all have every right to get mad at me but collectively we will have to abide by college rules and management decisions.   Once again, Sorry people. My sincere apologies. All said and done, I know you all will put your best foot forward  to make the first ever DEERUTSAV a grand success!  Thanks'",3

"""Hi All,  I just went through the list. Whoa, 37 performances! 37 performances in one show is one too many!!!  Simple rule of thumb tells us that even if one performance takes 6 minutes, we will have four hour show. Add the length of the 'plays', I am sure the timing will get elongated to unimaginable proportions.Chances are the sheer duration of the program itself will prove to fatal, suicidal spoiling the whole effort we have put in.  Also, I see a certain set of students trying to sing  as many as four songs! One song is good enough to showcase your talent. Furthermore, the entire concept of the DEERUTSAV 1.0 is about giving chances to everyone.  So please be prepared to impress us with your performance as I see no possibility of running a six hour show and managing to hold the attention of everyone for whole of six hours as we want to make a final selection in tomorrow's session.  You all are fantastic dancers, singers and performers. This event is also to encourage those who have ever appeared on a stage before. So, I request you all to rethink out of 'x' number of performances you have planned or have been practicing decide which one you really would want to perform.  At the end of the day, all it takes is one good performance to make your mark.  I sincerely expect you all to take this message in the right spirit! I want you all to do best, have fun, but not 'high-jack' the event in the process of doing so.  One appearance on stage is good enough! At max, we can entertain two. But sorry, we cannot have same faces appearing again and again.  Ideally, one is good enough.  Thanks.  PS: If you are thinking that some of your practices will now go to waste, that's completely the wrong inference that you are drawing. You should get thinking that 'of all the performances that I wanted to perform, I was lucky enough to showcase the one that I felt was the best.'  The other performances, save is for DEERFEST 2.0!

"'Menosh, No matter how the show goes tomorrow, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude for \'readying\' such a talented group of performers. Without you, we would not have been as confident as we are today. I know you would say its the students who did made this all possible. I agree with you but we all need someone to \'inspire"" us and you have been the greatest inspiration. So once again, I thank you on behalf of each and every member of small-big family called DWIT.   Performers, It was difficult to cut down on the performances. I did not have much choice but \'filter\'. I thank the performers for making my job easy - you made my job easy deciding yourselves which ones you would want pursue with and which ones to drop. If there were no \'barriers & constraints\' we certainly have included them all. The fact of the matter is there are so many \'things\' that I have to consider. So, if your performance got rejected or you had to unwillingly sacrifice any one of your much practiced performances, hope you understand. All said and done, trust me we will find a way out - nothing will go to a waste.  Crew Members, Your contribution today was fantastic. I specially would want to thank behind the \'scene\' people - members of music club for helping shortlisting the songs, the software club for designing the card, media club for designing the banner, MCs for trying to be on top of things till the very end, our sound engineer, Ankit for constantly asking me about arrangement for \'food\' for tomorrow.  Finally, These are typically done once event is over. That too me appears a bit too  cliched . Hence, my congratulations in advance to you all for putting up such a fantastic performance. I am super confident that you will make everyone celebrate this first ever celebration in a way that everyone will remember the event for a long time.  Thanks, Hitesh.  PS: Thank you Bijaya! I might appear to be little bias here but sitting here at office till 9:30 PM just to ensure that we do not miss out on anything is something I really appreciate.

"""Hi All,  Below is the sample of the DeerWord that was shared for first ever time. I looked at the date when I sent this template. It reads 02.21.2014.  We must have come across around 200 words. I hear people talking about preparation classes for TOEFL / GRE. Well I learned a lot of new words but of you have not, start thinking how any preparation classes will be of any help.  Also this gave me a fair idea as to how many of you would put in a  real  effort to do something as simple as this even though that was never the intention! From now on, I will have a more closer look at the word you pick and explanation you make. Oftentimes, I have not seen any difference between  Sentence Use  and  Meaning.  Every thing need to be explained in a manner everyone knows when exactly to use the word.  With this said, lets start with a new trend now. Every day you will now have to share two emails. One - continue with the ' DeerWord of the Day - Season II '. Pls mention Season II.  And next ' My Favorite App'. See next email.  Thanks.    Bandwidth    Bandwidth  - The word describes the maximum data transfer rate of a network. Its typically associated with the internet speed. It measures how much ( capacity ) data can be sent over a specific connection in a given amount of time.   Normal Day Use  - Apart from being used purely as technical term, the word is also used to explain the capacity of a person to perform a certain x number of tasks or for that matter capacity of anything to perform certain tasks in terms of quantity and not necessarily quality.   Sentence Use  -  Members of class of 2016, I am extremely sorry that I will not be able to take any further additional C Classes at this point in time because my bandwidth is completely exhausted.     Meaning  - I am completely occupied with other work that I am unable to take out to help you with programming in C.  Thanks.   PS: As mentioned in earlier mail, the next word will come from 0107 on Monday and we will follow the series described in earlier email. Shankar, please ensure that the format is exactly similar to this mail including the subject, font, line spacing and so on and so forth. The format should be ditto. If you are unsure please share it with me first before circulating to everyone. """,3

"'Hi All,  Having a portion of a chair cover torn ( Synthetic or Cloth ) can not be an accident. Then there are certain chairs that have certain portion of foam missing. Obviously we cannot have those ill-maintained chairs in the classrooms. Now the question is when and how we replace the chairs.  In other words, we cannot set rules saying we will repair chairs if so much percentage area of chair must is torn. Even if there is a minor tear, we have no choice but to replace. Worst comes to worse if we find that you are venting your anger on the chair and we happen to find you doing so, you will suddenly realize how valuable the chair was when you have to attend the class, standing! I am sure you all get this point clear.  We as a college need to look good and for that too happen, even the chairs need to look good. And by that I mean we need to be the best in every sense of the word.   Please do give due respect to the chairs it deserves.   Thanks. '",3

"""Dear All,    Discipline is an ornament of human,  this we have been hearing from the day we started to understand the things, either at your home or schools where you passed from. This is what makes us different from animal. Deerwalk Institute of Technology is doing its best to be the disciplined school of the Nation, not the strict school.   School discipline is the system of rules, punishments, and behavioral strategies appropriate to regulate the students and maintain the order in schools. Its aim is to control the students' actions and behavior. An obedient student is in compliance with the school rules and codes of conduct. These rules may, for example, define the expected standards of clothing, time keeping, social conduct, and work ethic.   The term discipline is also applied to the punishment that is the consequence of breaking the rules. The aim of discipline is to set limits restricting certain behaviors or attitudes that are seen as harmful or going against school policies, educational norms, school traditions, etc.   The goal of the DWIT College system is to provide a learning experience that allows all students to develop skills, competencies, and attitudes that are fundamental to a students achievement. In order to advance that goal, it is the responsibility of each student to study and maintain discipline. Refusal to comply with rules and regulations of the school shall constitute sufficient cause for discipline, suspension, or even expulsion. Any student may be subject to disciplinary action, if his/her actions on school are disruptive or are in violation of school rules and regulations.   Students charged with misconduct may be subject to the following sanctions    Warning: A written statement to the student that he/she is violating the student code of Conduct. This action may be taken by any faculty or staff.   Removal from Classes/Facility: Exclusion of a student by staff or faculty from a class and/or facility for the day of the offense and/or the next class, meeting or day.   Suspension: Action by the faculty or staff to exclude the student from all school either for one day or longer.   Expulsion: Action by school to terminate student.    Faculties Power    Faculties have statutory authority to discipline pupils whose behavior is unacceptable, who break the school rules or who fail to follow a reasonable instruction. They have special power to suspend the student who tries to disturb the class and spoil the learning environment.   At the end, please get to know that DWIT College is disciplined school but not the strict school.   Kindly maintain the discipline and prove yourself as the best citizen. """,3

"'Hi All,  The first step is where the maximum inertia is. You guys overcame this by doing the the first ""UNPLUGGED Session"" at DWIT. I may have played a spoil sport but that was just to get you guys going - I was really impressed to see people trying to bring their singing talent to the fore. We all have our inner passion but something stops us - \' the fear of being humiliated \'. They had not come prepared and yet as Sushant/Anmol mentioned, even a seasoned singers like them get nervous. So, to see some impromptu performances was really nice. I am sure whoever sang for first time, with a little bit of practice, you can do well in next time.  This is not to undermine the performances of those who had come prepared.  With a little more practice ( and equipments, of course! ) I know you guys literally give lot of singers a run for their money since they sing just to make an appearance on TV. The icing on the cake was the song written and composed by the members of the club!  I have a feeling that some day as we visit this years after we will have left this place, future Deerwalkers will be doing a cover version of that beautiful composition of yours!  It was awesome to be part of that program. You guys thoroughly entertained us. I really appreciate for putting in your time and effort to put together a cozy little program - we will only get better from here!  I was disappointed as well - to see people not attend the session, in spite of being here in the campus. If you were busy working as intern I have no comments. For rest, its not about whether you are into music or not - personally my take on music is that there\'s something wrong with you if you are not in music. You need to realize that if you want to be encouraged by others, you first need to learn the art of encouraging others. You could have easily done so by attending the event and appreciating the event, even if it was \'raw\'. Remember, we are all here to help each other out pursue our passion - things we could not do in school. Its no point giving up without trying. Hence, you see me run after each of the clubs.

"""Hello All,  Since you do not have regular classes today, you might be wondering about the way to utilize your day today. Reading books are certainly a nice option specially the fictions. The library is open today so drop by and enjoy reading the books.  Here are some of the fictional books that has recently been added to the library and you won't regret reading:   Master of the Games by Sidney Sheldon:   A story about Kate Blackwell, matriarch of Blackwell family and heads of her father's multinational business empire, Kurger-Brent Ltd. She recalls about her past, how her company started and describes about various members of her family.   And the mountains Echoed by Khalled Hosseni:   The novel, which somehow is written in the form of collections of short stories. It opens in the year 1952, with main characters Abdullah, 10 years old boy who unconditionally loves his three years old sister Pari and their father Saboor an impoverished farmer.   Munamadan by Laxmi Prasad Devkota:   One of the most successful and loved Nepali books which revolves around the love story of two characters Muna and Madan.   Narendra Dai by   Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala  :   A finest quality story plotted in a country's perspective. An epitome of compassionate and unconditional love of a women. Gauri bhauju's character's life is full of problems, still she is very strong not to let go of Narendra dai. Munariya character depicts a girl from a poor family, who is attracted by the worldly happiness and possessions and thus is lead to ruin her life. A story from the eyes of Ramesh, Narendra's little brother, this story repersents our rural, hill-located society. Yet the books is full of multi-languages, making it a cultural document too.   Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\xc3\xab:   A first-person narrative of the title character. The novel is set somewhere in the north of England, during the reign of George III (1760\xe2\x80\x931820), and goes through five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she acquires friends and role models but also suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her Byronic employer, Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St. John Rivers, proposes to her; and the finale with her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester.     Nothing to Declare by Ravi Thapa:   The experiences well put in the form of short stories that everyone can relate to at one point in their life. From hostel life, secrets with siblings, youth, insurgency, desires and the tradition and culture in Nepal that somehow binds us and some things that we cannot let go of. A book that has blended facts and fictions at just right amount     Happy Reading!  :)  With Regards,  The Library Team """,3

"'Hi All,  A quick note on the classes that are marked as \'PROJECT WORK\' in your routines. To start with, at least till the end of your respective semesters ( whichever semester you are in ), these classes are NOT free/off classes. These classes are like any other classes, and by virtue of this argument, you are expected to be in the class.Attendance and other stuffs, just like you have one taken in other classes, will be regularly taken. To end with, failing to meet 90% attendance will have some sort of effect. I am sure no one is asking what kind of \'effect\'?   Batch-wise engagement ( IN UTILIZING \'PROJECT WORK\' CLASS )  1. Class of 15  - You do not have much time to finish your project work.   2. Class of 16  - Coming up with a ""Software Requirement Specification"" and product based on that ""Software Requirement Specification"". Some of you have mentioned that you wanted to switch project. Make sure you get college\'s approval! Again, not much time on your hand.   3. Class of 17  - You all are getting started with ""Business Requirement Documentation"" based on Product Evaluation  that you did on Semester II with Craig. All prior Business Requirement Documents need to be submitted one week prior to finals and they aren\'t that far. Please utilize this class.   4. Class of 18  - You have two more weeks to decide on what kind of product you will be building. For now, you have seen your seniors present their papers and you too will have to do the same. In  addition  to this, we have figured out quite a lot of you are still struggling with very basics of programming. In addition to to \'C\', you had \'JavaScript\' & \' HTML\' covered in Semester I. Please start thinking of building small applications using basic HTML and JavaScript.   So, please make sure you get this message straight. I cannot allow people roaming around disturbing other classes and even going to the extent of asking for some leave. When asked don\'t you have any class, I have now begun to hear ""No, Class sir"" when routine clearly mentions ""PROJECT WORK""! Its rather unfortunate that we thought you would behave like Grad students and utlize your time.   Once again, I repeat, this is NOT a free class with immediate effect!   Thanks.

On 30th April a team from Deerwalk Institute of Technology went to Sankhu to understand the needs of the victims there. The team was lead by Hitesh Karki and consisted of students and volunteers. We went to Sankhu to try to understand what sort of assistance we can provide the locals and the victims.  When we arrived there, we saw that there are already many organizations that are already providing the victims the supplies they need. We went around and talked to many of the locals. All of them had sad faces and almost all of them had a sad story to tell. Many people were left homeless while many others had lost their loves ones. People are either missing or dead and, in some cases, their whereabouts are unknown. What we saw was not for the faint hearted. Everywhere all you could see was destruction and devastation. Entire neighborhood has collapsed. Parts of building have fallen or are just suspending on a broken wall, waiting to fall.  While some members of our team were investigating the site, other members were talking to the locals. They told us that, Sankhu is getting enough supplies but things are not properly maintained. What the locals currently are seeking for is an organized method of distribution of supplies. A person told is that, We have enough supplies. We have water, food, clothes and we are living in tents. What we need is an organized way of doing things. There are families who are able to come forward to demand supplies and are getting it while other families who unable to ask are being left behind. Another person said that, Volunteers are coming with supplies but are unable to help the ones who are truly in need of assistance and supplies. They go straight to people who, even in this time of crisis, act like victims to get what they want. They are unable to see the ones who can barely come front to demand basic needs. We met a woman who was taking care of 400 children with the help of some of her friends. When she saw us, she immediately told us everything. She told us how people are monopolizing the supplies. She is raising funds by herself to feed the children even though relief funds are coming in everyday. She told us, I have pleaded with the volunteers that come here to help us. We do not need water, food or a place to stay but what we need are able bodied people. We need people to help us clear some of the rubble to dig out the dead bodies. I along with my friends and children are digging out the bodies. Just the other day, we pulled out a couple of dead bodies from the fallen buildings. Hearing that things she said, we were deeply touched. By seeing with our own eyes what those people are going through, those of us living in our homes have it easy compared to them. It feels like we are living in another world. After seeing and understanding the needs of the people there, Deerwalk Institute of Technology is going to do everything in its power to help them.  On our way back, we met with a reporter from India. His name was V.S. Somashekar Gowda. He is also the world president of Clean Earth Green Earth, an organization that fights against mosquito born diseases. A student from DWIT, Suman Thapa, had a talk with him. They talked about where he was from and what he was doing there. He said, I came to Kathmandu to help the victims of the earthquake. I came alone from India. Many people there told me not to go but I wanted to help the victims. I came to distribute medical supplies which are with me. I came today to Sankhu to see the condition of the victims and what kind of assistance they require. I have seen and examined things here and will come back in two days with volunteers to distribute the supplies. He came to Kathmandu to help the victims but he himself is in need of some help. The main problem I am currently facing is that my SIM card does not work. My SIM which I brought from India does not work and the one which I got from a person here does not work either. So, it would be of great help if you could provies me a SIM for some days. Suman Thapa had a long talk with him and told him that he will help him out as soon as he can.  The day was productive and we inquired a lot a problems that the locals are facing. Sankhu need help but the help needs to be organized, unbiased and must fulfill the needs of the victims there. They need able bodied manpower to help them in doing many tasks.  Kundan S Rana ( Class of 17 )   As I rode my bike around town to see the devastating cause by the earthquake in the Kathmandu yesterday, I thought how things could get any worst. The places that were once of historical significance were in rubles. Buildings had collapsed and almost half the population of the city was taking shelter in an open area. People were living inside their tents with fear, sadness; scared of what might come next.  With all the images of my beloved town in ruins, I wanted to do all I could from my side to help people who are in need. I came to know that our college was taking an initiative to visit Sankhu, learn about the needs of people there, the situations they are currently living in and find ways to help them. From what I had gathered from the news, Sankhu was one of the places that was badly damaged by the earthquake.  As we reached there, the picture was clearer. The buildings that once stood tall were left in ruins. People were trying to find things that could be of use from their houses which had collapsed. There were parts of town that were too dangerous to visit as the buildings damaged by the earthquake could collapse at any moment. Most of the people there were in a state of panic. With their homes completely destroyed people were looking for help; help that came but one they never received. Talking to locals there, we found out that people came with food and clothes to distribute, but the majority of them failed to receive it. In those places, people were switching locations in hope of getting the relief materials which they needed to survive.  I was truly unaware of the situations at places where help has not yet reached. Before seeing Sankhu with my own eyes, I thought I was living in a nightmare; sleeping in a neighbor\'s garage, lack of electricity and no internet connection. But after seeing a place destroyed beyond words, it has made me realize that I was wrong. In such a dire situation that is occurring in our country, a small contribution from our side can truly make a difference in the livelihood of the people affected.   Pratibh Acharya (Class of 15)   Destruction is necessary but this is unacceptable. What I saw today was very disturbing. Most of the infrastructures were destroyed. There were no path which had no any house damaged. Where ever my eyes went I only saw ruins of the houses and people seeking help and support.   We interviewed some local people they made us aware that the reliefs that reached there were only distributed to the road side victims but the one in inner places where vehicles do not reach are not getting anything. Volunteers only reach to the easy places and remote areas are been neglected.   Abhisekh Khatiwada (Class of 18)    Sankhu, once historic cities, now has become a history of its own. There wasn\'t a single house made of bricks and mud that must have been built ages ago, not a single one of them. There was a certain kind of eerie feeling about the whole place - no one was crying. There were expressionless faces everywhere. We were told that the place has been inundated with media people around the world ever since the place was hit by the quake and that perhaps explained some people we overheard whispering ""People are in such dire stages and all they want to do is click photographs"". We felt guilty but there was no way we could explain to them that we were there to assess the damage and provide help.  Being a small township where each house was connected with the other, even the house that stood \'tall\', were bound to fall once the clean up operation would begin. We talked to some local policemen and they too seemed to have no clue as to what to do next and were waiting for instructions from office of Chief District Office.  On our way back we were stopped by group of army men. That did not scare us for nothing seem to scare us now. They asked if we could fit in 10-12 soldiers in our van and drop them off on our way back. We readily obliged. They told us that 60 of them managed to take only two bodies out working for 8 hours. Curios, we asked them weren\'t there any more bodies trapped inside and they told us that there was nothing they could do with bare hands. They knew there were more than dozen bodies trapped inside but with no instruments and lack of training they were unable to do much.  I thought that explained Nepal.We were never ready to handle a disaster of this scale.  --    ___________________________________    Rudra Pandey, PhD, Chairman and CEO \xe2\x94\x82Deerwalk Inc.\xe2\x94\x82430 Bedford Street, Lexington MA 02420   \xe2\x94\x82  rpandey@deerwalk.com <rpandey@deerwalk.com>\xe2\x94\x82781 325 2291 | 977-98010-91446 (Nep) | http://www.deerwalk.com <http://www.deerwalk.com>   --    DISCLAIMER: This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

"'Hi All,  This is a call for all the people who would want to lend their hand to do some cleaning up operation of Kathmandu.  We really want to reach far and out but upon talking to lots of agencies providing relief work, security still remains a bit of concern.  Hence as for now lets focus on Kathmandu.

"""Doing Our part at Kaalmochan Temple   Kundan S Rana ( Class of 2016 )    On 3rd may a team of staff and students from DWIT went to Kaalmochan Temple located at Thapathali. We went there to do our part of volunteering duties. We were team of 13 members. We went there at around 0130 PM and did our share of the work for the day till 0530 PM.  The situation there is bad. The main temple is completely destroyed and all that remain are the small statues and temples that surrounded it. We were sad to see that such a monumental temple built by Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana in the 1800s was destroyed. We have lost a part of our culture and our heritage.  While we were there we saw that members of the army were trying to pull out the statues that were buried underneath the massive pile of rubble. They did succeed in doing so. They pulled out a seven foot long Shiva statues and a Laxmi Narayan statue. The statues were not destroyed but were a little damaged. Usually along side the statues there were a lot of smaller statues and utensils that were used for pooja. They were destroyed.  All of us left satisfied knowing that we had done something useful and our actions made a small difference. Along with this feeling we were also disheartened that we lost such a beautiful and historical heritage site.   Barsha Dahal ( Class of 2017 )   Without long or specific planning we decided to go KaalMochan Ghat at Tripureshwor. The way this old temple was destructed by Earthquake was spine-chilling. I knew how dangerous recent earthquake was after visiting there because I am staying in the locality where I had not seen much destruction.  I actually wanted to help hungry, thirsty and helpless victims. So, at first I was not satisfied. We reached there and saw how terrifying this disaster could be and decided to remove the debris as much as we can. Seeing a cultural or historical monument being destroyed and broken into pieces broke my heart. I could feel the pain somewhere inside me while I carried the first brick after reaching there.We worked as a team and carried the bricks. The way our team worked taught me something. Helping each othercan make the task fascinating, even though that task is very exhausting and toilsome. I was feeling proud to act as if I was an engineer or the worker. Really, no task is boring. It depends on with whom you work. No doubt, carrying bricks or cleaning was never a task of entertainment for me, but today I certainly loved cleaning.  I am damn tired right now. But this tiredness taught a great lesson and gave a kind of relief. At least we did something, better than sleeping in a room and imagine the earth is shaking all the time.   Sanjeev Mainali ( Class of 2016 )   When I saw an email regarding the call for volunteer for cleaning up operation of Kathmandu  I decided to join my hands and headed to my college at around  1 pm .There were already some people at the college ready to visit the site. At first I have no idea about the site which we were going to visit later when we packed all the equipments ,some jars of water and moved I came to know that we were about to clean the temple near Thapathali which was completely destroyed by the earthquake. There were many volunteers from different organizations. We on the behalf of DWSWN also joined them and helped them, the best way we can.  We were altogether 13 volunteers, there, we picked the bricks that can be re-used and piled them in proper place. Making a line of six we divide our team into two lines and passed the bricks picking them from the ground and properly piling them ina proper place so that it can be re-used in future. As being a student I have never done such activities in my life and after doing so I was so happy, happy to help my countries cultural heritage site get cleaned.  After collecting thousands of brick from that area I felt like I ,being a Nepali ,had managed to contribute something from my side to my country in this situation where a small help means a lot.I really felt very happy to be a part of DWSWN to help in cleaning my motherland Nepal and my hometown Kathmandu .   Abhisek Khatiwada ( Class of 2018 )   Today 3rd May , 2015 we went for 'Clean up mission'  Day was hot and atmosphere was full of mud. We wore masks, gloves and safety mates and stepped out of the Deerwalk van. The temple area was totally destroyed only some monuments were standing alone. Volunteers and armed force police team were doing their job.  Our motive was to help the rescue team with whatever we can. We were asked to pick the bricks from the temple and stack them on the side of the temple area. APF were busy excavating the destroyed part. We made a team and passed the bricks from the top. I think that was the best thing we could offer at that moment.  Idols of gods were being taken out and secured. Reporters were busy capturing the moment. Bigger idols were still trapped inside the temple. We gathered as many bricks as we can.  We learnt more about team work and the enthusiasm and energy for helping the victims or affected area has grown big. Yes there is a long path to travel to recover this sorrow but it is possible if we unite together and do jobs like we did today.  We left the place late promising to do more and help the needy as much as we can.    Prayush Shrestha ( Class of 18 )   9 days after the massive quake I decided to do some volunteering  so went college. We set out to move towards our destination, our initial destination was Gongabu and Balaju to clean that area but decided to go to Thapathali instead, we put on our helmet, gloves and masks which made us feel like an engineer thus we group of 15 engineers set out to Kalmochan Temple situated at Thapathli .The temple was completely destroyed , there were policemen ( APF - Armed Police Force ) and very few volunteers cleaning the area and taking out things of archaeological importance which normal volunteers were not allowed to do .   We then decided to arrange the remains of the temple, we separated brick that could be re used and wood pillars and arranged them. The work was obviously not easy the scorching sun also made it hard but we did it anyway and made a difference. I am really not bothered about the magnitude of difference. All I felt was I was able to help the country in some way at this critical juncture. Talking about my experience it was awesome; you dont always get to carry a century old bricks do you?       --    ___________________________________    Rudra Pandey, PhD, Chairman and CEO \xe2\x94\x82Deerwalk Inc.\xe2\x94\x82430 Bedford Street, Lexington MA 02420   \xe2\x94\x82  rpandey@deerwalk.com <rpandey@deerwalk.com>\xe2\x94\x82781 325 2291 | 977-98010-91446 (Nep) | http://www.deerwalk.com <http://www.deerwalk.com>   --    DISCLAIMER: This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

"""Hello Hitesh Dai,  One of the places I've learnt which is in desperate need of relief is Aapghari village of Jivanpur VDC in Dhading District. It's my sister's place and I have learnt that almost all the houses in the village were collapsed. I spoke to my brother in law this morning about the situation there and he said no relief from any government/non-government agencies have reached there yet. The place is about 24 KMs from Sitapaila, Kathmandu. If we could do something through DWSWN, it would be great.  Thanks. Bimarsh.

"""Bimarsh,  I am going to say what I said to Sushma.  Any way you can coordinate relief effort? We definitely want to help that place but are still undecided as to what exactly do with that place. Can you arrange for local contacts so that distribution can be safe and more or less hassle-free? There are lots of rumors of security issues.  I will talk to you tomorrow.

Ankit Karki( Editor) - Out of valley 5. Shreya Acharya (News Reader) - Out of valley 6. Sajak Raj Baidhya ( Cinematographer) - House is badly damaged and is shifting somewhere else 7.

However at the same time, this is time when world is watching what's going on in Nepal. So it would not be very smart for us to say Dharahara fell on so and so date after one month.   You could focus on story of one single family - if you been affected in any way - it could be your story too!  Thanks  """,3
"""Hi All,  I am sure everything fine with you. Here's the latest DWSWN has done in response to your requests. Please bear in mind that this does not include daily activities that we are doing daily.  I strongly urge you to refer to sites like deerwalkswn.org, https://www.facebook.com/deerwalkswn?ref=hl, http://www.blakeleyfoundation.org/category/nepal-fund/ to see what's been happening.  The update below can give you some idea as to what we seek for. If I have missed any of your resquests please let me know. When I say requests, I am only talking about requests made in response to my earlier email offering help.  I thoroughly understand that there is a need everywhere - you don't even have to places far off - its just that the relief material should directly reach the needy people and for that you need to have some local contact. Anymore requests, please feel free to contact me.  Thanks, Hitesh K.   Please note that we currently have tarpaulins (100 pieces) and clothes collected from various places. The majority of the collected clothes are already been filtered as we do not want to donate ragged clothes. Remaining are being selected as I write this!     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Below is the response to your specific request.  1.     1.  Requested by : Prayush Shrestha - STUDENT   Request: I heard area around Bungmati is in need of help. I am not sure but will talk to people of that area and inform you.  STATUS: He has not got back to us.     2.    2. Requested by : Pratik Joshi - EMPLOYEE    Request: I have a friend who lives in Balthali, Kavre. He asked for 50-60 tents and mattresses only as of now. He can be reached at 9851189959. Another friend of mine who lives in Gorkha said they need tents and mattresses urgently. He lives in Gorkha Sadarmukam but he asked for the tents and mattresses in nearby villages. He will be in Kathmandu today. He can meet you to discuss about how he can deliver the items in his intended nearby villages.  STATUS: Pratik has sent a request to a donor in Norway. We want to help but GORKHA, the intended target, but at this point in time, the place beyond Gorkha has security risks.    3.    3.    Requested by : Sujesh Shakya - EMPLOYEE    Request : I have a relative who has lost their home as well as her uncle and her brother in this devastating Earthquake. She desperately needs help right now.  STATUS: We are providing her with some cash as token of gesture, Rs 10,000. This is being done today as we needed to talk to the person and see the house.    4 .   4.   Requested by : Susma Pant - EMPLOYEE    Request : I was visited Gajuri and Kumpur VDC in Dhading. I was distributing a sum of NPR 60,000 to six persons who lost family members due to the earthquake from Deerwalk SWN site in the last week. There were 95 % houses as well as school collapsed. There is no any agencies have reached yet. These places are completely remote area and about 85 KM far from Kathmandu. If we could do something through DWSWN, it would be fruitful.  STATUS : As discussed with her, we cannot handle the entire place. Hence, we are coordinating with one of the local people who hopefully will find a village for us to support. Should we get a confirmation from that place, we could move during the weekend. We will need at-least 3-4 lacs for this place alone.     5.    5.   Requested by : Saroj Shrestha - STUDENT   Request : I have recently visited Barabise, Sunkoshi, Lamasanghu and other places of Sindhupalchowk district. Most of the houses around Kathmandu-Kodari highway are completely destroyed. I saw some agencies providing foods to the victims, but that was not sufficient. Only 1 kg rice and 1 packet noodles was distributed to each people and only 25-30 people got the food and other had to return back with despair. People from the village go to the highways and Bazar's in the hope of relief funds and food, but they haven't got any actual relief funds and foods. It would be great if we could help them.  STATUS: Saroj has been asked to find out if he has some local contacts or else we going there will just make matters worse.    6.    6.   Requested by : Meena Kusi - EMPLOYEE   Request: I am from Bhaktapur and I know people who have lost their family members and they have no shelter to live either, so if we could provide them some help.it would be  a great relief for them.  STATUS: She just met me and unlike the 'original needs', the needs now has shifted to health related issues. There are barely few organisations providing drinking water purifiers and other medicines and clothes as they have lost everything. We plan to go to the place today, talk with local people in her presence and go distribute the needed items by tomorrow.    7.    7.   Requested by : Saroj Neupane - EMPLOYEE   Request: I am heading back to my village in Dolakha. Everything is flattened and I have already cordinated with the local officials. There will be no security or any logistical issues.  STATUS: We have handed him with Rs 1,20,000.00. He made 36 packages of Rs 1,800 each comprising of one 30 kg sack of rice and one packet of salt. Another package was made comprising of one 30 kg sack of rice and one packet of salt, a liter of cooking oil costing Rs 2000 each. These were distributed to 20 households.    .  --    DISCLAIMER: This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank one and all for the support and encouragement.  I am little sad to leave this place. I have had a lot of fun here and learned so much. However, it is just time to move on to something different. It was great getting to know you all and to get a chance to work with each one of you. Hoping to meet you again someday, somewhere. till then goodbye. I hope to keep in touch in some form. I'm on LinkedIn and can be reached by email at alokkoirala@gmail.com.  I wish Deerwalk and everyone here much success in the future.

"""Hi All,  Let me introduce you to your new English teacher, Hilary Towle.  She will arrive here on 5th of July and assuming that she manages to do away with jet-lag, she will start taking classes from 6th. She is about to complete her M.Ed course from Harvard. If someone's completed his/her masters from Harvard, I think trying to explain much about that person would not make much sense :)  Hilary,  As discussed in our earlier conversations over Skype and emails, all 47 students from Freshmen Year will be writing to you introducing themselves to you. Apart from the intro, they will also share about the kind of books they enjoy, favorite movies and actors. But most important of all will be they will also be sharing what aspect of 'English' they really want to improve on under your guidance. This is something I believe will help you planning re how to move ahead with the classes and other activities.  If you feel like introducing yourself to the students, please feel free to do so.  Talk to you later in the day.  Best, Hitesh.   PS: Please write to Hilary. You know the email now! If you are not from Class of 18 but feel like reaching out to her, there's no stopping. After all she's one of your faculty members! """,3
"Hi,   My question to you is,  ""Why did you join DWIT?"" Is it just to pass B.Sc.CSIT and get the degree?  Or  make yourself a complete and skilled IT graduate?  If it is just to get the degree, there are so many Schools offering the same course. If you really want to be a complete and skilled IT graduate, try spending enough time in the school. Only attending the lecture will not make you real DWITians and Skilled IT graduate.  You must engage your self in different activities, finish all those DWIT credit courses, term papers, semester projects and other to be graduated from DWIT.     I am writing you to inform about staying in the school for longer time as addressed by our  Executive Chairperson in todays ALL HANDS MEETING.  If your class goes off at 3:20 pm, it does not mean that your school time is over by 3:20. There might be many activities going on till 7:00 pm and you can join those activities. It is not necessary to hold your school bag and run for home as soon as the class goes off. This is not the way DWIT is looking our students to be graduated.   Even in today\'s ALL HANDS MEETING, there were few people joining after the time was passed. They were not new people, they were the same whom school has supposed to be late. When you had joined DWIT, all of you were in the same label. But now, its you who pushed yourself behind your friends. They will be far away from you in their students life, while you will remain at the same label. I always keep on saying this.   So many voices of not involving in clubs and participating in DWIT events are shame to listen. There are many activities going on but you never paid interest to join. You can participate in those events, if not, at least be to cheer the event. DWIT always welcome new activities from the choice of students. You do not have to wait for a month and meet someone to share your idea about ECA, just write an email.   You don\'t have to play varsity football or be selected president/ vice-president. There are many ways to showcase your talents and achievements with so many programs and club activities. Getting involved in clubs, sports, works outside the classroom can give you the new skills and help you learn about yourself and can be fun. Getting involved in extracurricular activities help you become comfortable with the school environment. This is even more important during the first year of college \xe2\x80\x93  Batch 2018 .   It is important to receive good grades during your school career; however, being involved in extracurricular activities and getting work experience, like an internship, is valued more. It is possible only if you spent more time in the school. It allows you to get hands-on experience in the field you will be working in. Receiving good grades prove that you worked hard and can hit the books. But the more impressive than proving you hit the books is that you took the time to be involved in a club or to help tutor other students. If you devoted your time to help tutor someone, it shows that you\'re someone that can make a difference.   All in all, good grades can get you scholarships and give you a sash to put on your graduation gown that shows you graduated with honors. Although it is quite an achievement, having work experience, knowing people and having developed social skills, along with having a valuable work ethic, is much more important in the long run. There\'s more to the school life experience than the classroom. School life offer endless opportunities to get involved as well.    Here are few reasons to spend longer time in the school and experience school life.    1. Spending more time in the school connects you to the school.  School has full of resources, but it is your responsibility to seek them out. Being involved helps you to do that.   2. Getting involved in school helps to discover friends with similar interests. You may come with new idea and carry the entrepreneurship. It is neither going to happen by the bless of god nor receive in dreams.   3. Sometimes, busier student do better in all areas. This will vary a lot by the student, of course, but more free time does not always equal better grades. Being involved will require some organization and time management on the part of the student and that\'s a good thing.    I personally suggest few way to keep yourself busy in the school.    1. Utilize your school\'s resources may be library, lab, online, learning with friends.    2. Try everything at least once. You may not like every club and event, but keep an open mind! Go outside of your comfort zone; oftentimes these are the most rewarding experiences. You may not think you\'ll enjoy the Software club or the DeerChautari sessions, but one of the best things about DWIT is you have the opportunity to try new things.   3. Realize that being involved is an ongoing process. Involvement on school shouldn\'t be solely restricted to permanent positions like you being president of certain club for four year.   I am pretty sure that you will plan to spend your time in DWIT to experience the real school life. Do not miss the opportunity as the  time and tide waits for none . Four years is a very short time and you have to sharp yourself.   Thanks,   Bijaya. '",3

Toilet etiquette is all about hygiene and cleanliness. All of us know toilet can be germ ridden places. If enough care is not taken to adopt hygienic practices we can contribute to the spread of many types of disease. To keep it hygienic, rule is simple, if you mess it; clean it.   For your information, we have listed the following common sense and logical rules of restroom, urinal, or toilet etiquette to bring us back on track:   1. Please ensure the toilet is covered after you're done.    [image: Inline image 1][image: Inline image 2]    2. Gents, please do not use the toilet for urinating. Please use the Urinal.

"""Hi All,  I am pleased to announce that following people  have been selected to work as Research Coordinators to work at DWIT.  They are  1. Sushant Pandey 2. Deependra Shrestha 3. Prasanna Pandey 4. Meena Shah  As you all must have read in the job announcement mail, this is a pretty demanding role and I, along with my colleagues at DWIT, are excited about having these people on board.  DWIT has managed to establish itself as one of the best colleges to study Computer Science in spite of none of our students having graduated yet! That's pretty unheard of and with programs like these we simply want to be the best in the business. Needless to say, our expectation from you four is really high and am confident that your contribution as Research Coordinators will help us become the best IT School!  My appreciation also goes out to everyone who applied for this position.  Had number not been a restriction we could have chosen almost all of the applicants at one go. If not a Research Coordinator, we will for sure start asking you conduct various seminars and workshops to students in days ahead. Its good to see many of you already prepped up for such activities. Its just a beginning and am sure we will come up with innovative ideas in days ahead.  Congratulations to the selected Research Coordinators!  Thanks Hitesh Karki. """,3

"'Dear All,  It is with deep regret that I would like to inform you that the college disciplinary team has decided to suspend one of our students for being involved in  plagiarism.  He has been found breaking the school rule which is an offense that could have easily lead to expulsion from college. Needless to say, Deerwalk Institute of Technology does not tolerate any kind of  PLAGIARISM . Hence he has been suspended from the college.  Once again it is rather an unfortunate decision that the college is forced to make but at the same time we simply cannot afford to overlook the incident.  Please be reminded that it could have led to direct expulsion from the college. Plagiarism is the worst offense that any student can make during student life.  Thanks,  Bijaya. '",3

"""Hi everybody,  As I mentioned previously, our practical exam will not be conducted in a regular manner. Our initial plan was to divide the exam in to 2 sections; an idea submission and the program submission. Since we do not have much time now, we will be conducting both in a same day. Here is what you need to do;     1. Come up with an idea to represent a real world object by an object in    C++ program. (I am sure that this has already been done by you)    2. Prepare a document which presents the attributes and behaviour of    that object that your are going to cover. A simple class diagram, or a flow    diagram or even a list of attributes will do. Try to make your document as    presentable as possible.    3. Write a C++ program to demonstrate your ability to represent a real    world object using object oriented programming techniques that you've    learned during the semester.  On July 8, I will have one-on-one with each of you to go with your project. There will be an QA session based on your understanding and presentation of your document and program. I'll talk to Bijaya and will share with you the class room and the timing later. Also, if you do not have a laptop and need to use one of our collage computers, please let me know. You  DO NOT  need to make a hardcopy of your program and documentation.  Should you have any queries, please let me know as soon as possible.

"'Dear All,  We would like to inform you all that, we have just completed configuring and installing new Access Points and CISCO Manageable Smart Switches at different locations inside the college building. According to the vendor, each AP is  powerful enough to handle up-to 50 clients, this will overcome the defects of normal Access Points and eliminates the existing issues of connectivity to the wireless internet. The CISCO Manageable switches are very much useful in detecting the loop-back, managing the network, managing the bandwidth distribution, setting up virtual networks and many more.   Since we are new in operating these devices we will be observing their performances until the last of this week and proceed for the permanent setup. So I on the behalf of IT Club would like to request you all to send your feedback, issues with the wireless network connectivity and any kind of problems you faced while using the internet inside the college   P.S : There is no any change in the hostpot services, So use your own existing hotspot credentials.   --    Kind Regards,Suryaraj Timsina ,  Student  | Deerwalk Institute of Technology,  I  T Intern   \xe2\x94\x82  Deerwalk Services Pvt.

"'FYI  Dear All,  Forwarded is an email from Hitesh sir to class of 2017 regarding the small change in school\'s policy on  low attendance percentage to sit for final term exam . From now, we are allowing our students to sit for final term examination even though they do not meet minimum attendance percentage. But we will deduct certain marks from the score of final term paper of the respective subject.  Here you go with deduction formula. Calculation is based on our supposition that you score 100 out of 100 in the exam.  All candidates failing to meet the minimum attendance percentage will have 10% universal deduction. In addition to this, formula mentioned in below table will be followed.    Attendance Percentage    Absentee Percentage    Marks Deducted    Additional Penalized Marks    Actual Deduction    Final Score   85  0-5  5  2  17  83  80  10-Jun  10  4  24  76  75  15-Nov  20  7  37  63  70  16-20  30  11  41  49  65  21-25  40  0  50  50  60  26-More  50  0  60  40  For example, if you have 85% attendance is any subject, your actual deduction will be 17% of the obtained marks. This is how calculation will be made,  (universal deduction of 10%  + 5% deduction because you have 85% attendance + 2% additional penalized   because you have 85% attendance   = 17% of obtained score)  . Finally you will be granted only 83 if you secure 100 out of 100 in your exam.  I think you are clear.  Thanks,  Bijaya.   ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: hitesh karki <hitesh.karki@deerwalk.edu.np> Date: Fri, Jun 12, 2015 at 6:50 PM Subject: Re: Ineligible to sit for the exmination To: Bijaya Shrestha <bijaya.shrestha@deerwalk.edu.np> Cc: _classof17@deerwalk.edu.np, ""_dwitadmin@deerwalk.edu.np"" <_ dwitadmin@deerwalk.edu.np>   Hi All,  Please be informed that should you chose to sit for exams, you will be able to even though deemed \'ineligible\'.  This is a slight modification we have made in the existing rule. Someday we will explain why.  However, please be aware of the fact that you will NOT be marked out of TOTAL MARKS. In other words, higher the number of absentee days, you will be penalized accordingly while being evaluated.  To put it in plainly, in extreme cases where you have missed almost all classes,  you might be able to sit for exams and yet come out with 0 . Or if the offense is NOT  that  serious, you would still be able to sit for exams but even if you answer all the questions correctly,  you will NOT be awarded with a score of 100/100 assuming that\'s the full marks .  I am sure you all understand what I mean.  Thanks.  > > '",3

Once again it is rather an unfortunate decision that the college is forced to make but at the same time we simply cannot afford to overlook the incident.  Please be reminded that it could have led to direct expulsion from the college. Plagiarism is the worst offense that any student can make during student life.  Thanks,  Bijaya. '",3

"Top Stories from Your Feed Your Quora Digest  -----   Question: Why is 9gag called 9gag?  Answer from Peter Zhang Jake\'s answer is not quite correct. ""9"" is pronounced ""gou"" in Cantonese. It sounds like another word ""gau"", which literally means ""make, create"". We use the slang ""gau gag"" a lot in every day speech. By itself it doesn\'t mean much: ""make joke""; but when used in a sentence, it can mean a lot more - for example, ""are you \'gau gag\'-ing right now?"" would mean something like ""are you serious?"".

"Hi All,  Late evening ,last night I got into a Skype ( Video )  meeting with some professors from Seoul National University. As I have been mentioning our attempts to reach out to them seemed to have resulted in some positive outcome.  They have provided us with following offer.  Come August, they will take 12 students of DWIT to visit their campus in Seoul, South Korea for 2 weeks. They said gender equality is a big concern for them and hence team composition will be such that there will have to be 6 girls and 6 boys. While in SNU ( Seoul National University ) you will get to interact with members of faculty and even attend one or two computer science lectures. The visit to some of the places of interest like SAMSUNG headquarters still have not been finalized yet. I am told that possibility of that happening is very high. The best part is all expenses will be borne by them and hence you will not have to spend anything.  I have been told that selection and processing needs to be done soon. They plan to invite students from couple of other smaller countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bhutan round about the same time so timing needs to be worked out as early as possible.  If you are interested please share your name with Bijaya Sir!  Thanks. '",4

"Dear All,  In 2011 earthquake of japan, rescue team reached to a completely destroyed house. In between the pieces, they saw a lady with knelled down position and looked like she was praying with god. One of the rescue team member went near by and touched her body by passing his hands between the broken pieces. It was too cold and proved she was dead. Then after, they decided to leave and move to the next. However, one of the member of rescue team could not hide the scene from his eyes and returned back to the dead body of the lady. He took his hand up to her and tried to find if there is something under her body. As soon as he felt something alive, shouted, ""Child.. Child.. Here is a Child"". All members of the rescue team gathered, cleaned up, and found a small three months baby boy. They took him to the hospital. The doctor declared that he is healthy. Along with the baby, they had found a small piece of paper written, ""If you are able to be alive, remember I love you so much"".  This is what called mothers love. In the story, mother indicates family. You have got to experience lots of loving and caring time with your family in this painful and bitter situation, caused due to Nepal earthquake - 2072. Now, its your time to give in return. And i know, you are confident enough to fight with tiny aftershocks. Its an opportunity to prove yourself that you are grown up and have become a matured bachelor level students. Your parents have lots of hopes and dreams on you.  Via this email, I am formally writing you to inform about the start of your semester after the devastating earthquakes 2015 in Nepal. I know we are at hard and terrifying situation, but we are running the full fledged classes from  June 1, 2015 . As per our understanding, the ministry of education is not in position to loss this academic year. Most probably, TU will extremely try to catch the examination schedule as soon as the academic activities begins. So the coming academic days are supposed to me more productive and busy.  I hope that you had loving and caring time with your family, and that you had best utilized the time with them. And even i understand that you are looking forward to a calm and fearless academic environment. For this, you have come back with renewed energy.  As the classes gets under way, you will take advantage of the many opportunities that the school offers to you in internship, academic development, research, clubs involvement and much more. This will certainly wash away the physiological fears of Earthquake. Lets look forward and pray for a great and smooth academic environment together.  Class routine and section division will remain the same.  However, school have changed your classes to the new location within Deerwalk Complex. To understand more about the changes made, school has called an important meeting with you on Sunday,  May 31, 2015 at sharp 9:00 am . This is mandatory to attend by all the students.

"Hi,  It was not new talking to you but it was different as we were talking in different topic. It was hard trying to bind the stories from hell about Mr. Gore Lal to stories from heaven about the Department of Thank You in short time. And more, my journey from Sree Panchakanya Lower Secondary School, a small school in a village of Chitwan district to Politechnico di Torino, 265th ranked QS World Top universities. I have shared the link at the bottom of the page.  Stories and conclusion were simple  ""Never Give Up"",  as the WWE United States Champion wrestler John Cena says. You must give a try and try putting your opinion. You heard the story of writing an email asking for compensation to Erasmus committee due to delay in visa process. You might have seen 17 conversations in the same email loop for the problem during my presentation.  Few summarized points are,  1. Always have eager to apply and do not wait for the deadline. Maybe, scholarship of NRs 1,700 that i received during my bachelors was an inspiration. Though it was small amount, it had high credit. Scholarship worth $50 offered by Microsoft and 320 euro offered by DAAD were supportive documents to make me Erasmus candidate. There are so many opportunities flying around us. We do not pay attention as they count small amount. But do not forget a famous Nepali quotation "" thopa thopa milera nadi bancha ""  2. Keep trying, never give up, i did not receive Erasmus on my first try. I was rejected many times. While digging the reasons of rejection, i saw the fault in CV writing. I shared the stories of joining British Council just to learn CV writing.  3. Do not forget to enjoy in the new places. Rather than learning Italian Language and Association Rule Algorithms, my experience about October Fest and Going to Disco had made my short stay in Europe memorable. You will get chance to learn culture and of course the new friends.  Furthermore, they keep communicating with their grantee even the project is over and update about the available opportunities. Surprisingly, they had written me a nice email to ask for any help, if i am required, due to this Earthquake. Erasmus Scholarship offers not only the monthly grant but many facilities. I am sharing some links about Erasmus Projects that offers scholarship. Right now, i have the information about these Erasmus projects. I will obviously share information about new projects as soon as they send me info email.
